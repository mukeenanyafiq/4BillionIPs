# 4BillionIPs's Project
In this project that I created out of my boredomness, I tried to generate 4 billion IPs (or exact 2^32) and publish it in this repository. It said that it took approximately **57.1 GB** (61.337.505.792 bytes (what??)) of disk storage that I have

This file is so big my Notepad couldn't read it allat (I couldn't even upload it to GitHub)

You COULD try contributing to this project by making an even optimized script that generates 4 billion IPs in different programming language in probably no time
