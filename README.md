# 4BillionIPs's Project
In this project that I created out of my boredomness, I tried to generate 4 billion IPs (or exact 2^32) and publish it in this repository. It took approximately **68.72 GB** of disk storage that I have

Was this worth enough? No.

But you COULD try contributing to this project by making an even optimized script that generates 4 billion IPs in different programming language in probably no time
