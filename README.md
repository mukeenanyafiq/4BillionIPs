# 4BillionIPs's Project
In this project that I created out of my boredomness, I tried to generate 4 billion IPs (or exact 2^32) and publish it in this repository. It said that it took approximately **57.1 GB** (61.337.505.792 bytes (what??)) of disk storage that I have

This file is so big my Notepad couldn't read it allat (I couldn't even upload it to GitHub)

You COULD try contributing to this project by making an even optimized script that generates 4 billion IPs in different programming language

# Rules of generating 4 billion IPs
- Must be IPv4 (of course.)
- Use built-in module that is pre-installed
- Each IP has 4 different number positions ranging from 0 to 255
- Sorted from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
- Have 2 version of the script (storage-usage & memory-usage)
